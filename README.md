# Tic Tac Toe Application with Nakama Backend

This repository contains a Tic Tac Toe frontend application and instructions to run it with the Nakama backend server using Docker.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- Ubuntu or Linux-based system
- Git
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js and npm

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone and Run Frontend

Clone the frontend repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kishorevenai/tic-tac-toe-application.git
cd tic-tac-toe-application
npm install
```

Clone the nakama repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama.git
cd nakama
docker compose up
```



## Usage Instructions

Once the frontend and Nakama backend are running, follow these steps:

1. Sign Up / Log In

Open the frontend in a browser.

Sign up with a username and password (or log in if already registered).

Nakama handles authentication and session management.

2. Create a Room

After logging in, click “Create Room” to start a new Tic Tac Toe game.

The created room appears in the list of available rooms.

Share the room ID with a friend if you want them to join directly.

3. Join a Room

You can join a game in three ways:

Join a specific room

Enter the room ID shared by another player.

Join a random room

Click “Join Random” to be matched with any available room waiting for a second player.

Wait for other players

Rooms remain in the list until someone joins.

4. Playing the Game

Once two players are in a room, the game starts automatically.

Players take turns placing X or O in the Tic Tac Toe grid.

The winner is determined by Nakama backend, which synchronizes moves in real time.
